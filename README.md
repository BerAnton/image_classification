# Image classification

Repository consist of two simple architectures of convolutional neural networks:

### 1. ResNet-50

The work was done as a part of the course 4 "Convolutional Neural Networks" from deeplarning.io specialization on Coursera.

### 2. ResNet-152

Contains neural network implementation, described in K. He, X. Zhang, S. Ren, J. Sun 
"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" (arXiv:1512.03385v1[cs.CV])
Due to small amount of memory on my laptop, batch size was reduced to 4.

Datasets were obtained from course 4 "Convolutional Neural Networks"
